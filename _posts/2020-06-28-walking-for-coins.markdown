Walking can also be financially rewarding. There are quite a few different applications that are coming out now that will reward you with coins when your out and about.

One of the more popular ones is Sweatcoin. They are currently one of the fastest growing health applications! The way this works is that you run the application in the background on your phone or watch and then you will accumulate coins based on the number of steps that you have performed that day. There are certain limits on the number of coins you can initially earn in one day, however these can be improved with `boosts` that allow you the option to earn even more sweatcoins.

Once you have earned an amount of the coins these can then be used to purchase goods or services. You can also donate the coins to charity if you would like.

If this sounds like something your interested in please feel free to check out the referal link below and to learn more about Sweatcoin.
