The Money and Pensions Service has published a guide which details the UK strategy for financial wellbeing. It is a welcome indicator that the UK Government instituions are attempting to provide further information to people which will enable to them to better control their finances.

What is the plan?

> We spent 12 months listening to our stakeholders and developing a new UK Strategy for Financial Wellbeing, which is designed to drive change at scale and shift the dials on personal finance. 

The service is looking to push this over a 10 year period to try and help everyone ensure they are making the best decisions when it comes to their finances. Some of the key themes within this strategy include topics such as providing better debt advice as well as enabling people to have more of a "Future Focus" which will hopefully allow people to better prepare for later in life financial considerations.

They are also looking to provide online webinars for people across the UK.
